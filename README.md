# Codename-Riggy
Open source game based on Riggy the rabbit monkey's lore.
This will be possible thanks to https://www.youtube.com/@DannoDraws/videos and https://www.youtube.com/@RiggyRunkey. 
I will update this repository once I am able to build the GUI
I will archive this repository once the finalised version is released as the actual name is different
Also, I want Riggy to be aware of this project
